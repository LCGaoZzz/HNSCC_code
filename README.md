# HNSCC_code

**Code for selected plots and data analyses in the HNSCC project.**

This repository contains scripts used in generating specific visualizations and performing analytical steps related to the study of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC).

## Repository Structure

The repository includes two main folders:

- `python_scripts/`: Contains code written in **Python**, used for tasks such as:
  - Single-cell RNA-seq preprocessing
  - Dimensionality reduction and clustering (e.g., UMAP, PCA)
  - Visualization (e.g., violin plots, dot plots)
  - Correlation and enrichment analysis
  - Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)-based module detection
  - Spatial transcriptomics analysis (e.g., cell type deconvolution)

- `R_scripts/`: Contains code written in **R**, used for:
  - Visualization
  - NicheNetR
